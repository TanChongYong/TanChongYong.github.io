<p><img src="//localhost:1313/tedx/img/canton fair.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I flew over to GuangZhou for the annual Canton Fair, where many suppliers would gather to display their products. Although the minimum order quantity (MOQ) is too high, I still learnt a lot by talking to different vendors to get data on the entire distribution process and OEM model.</p>
