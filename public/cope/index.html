Things rarely stick to the original plans without deviation, and we must always be agile enough to make changes whenever necessary. This venture gave me a deeper understanding of operations and appreciate the importance of thinking business, a skillset which I was lacking before."</h1>

<p><img src="//localhost:1313/cope/img/sg best clean.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>SEO has always been an evolving puzzle to solve, and I had great joy in constant monitoring and optimizing the site for ranking.</p>

<p>I am always striving to learn new things, and I believe that many things are achievable if you are willing to put in the time and effort
to learn. Although it took me sometime to rank the site, the self-process of discovery and experimenting is something which I enjoyed doing
very much.</p>

<p>Once again, hooray for ranking first for that search term! :)</p>

<h1 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h1>

<p><img src="//localhost:1313/cope/img/leaders.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I had a blast working with Lewis, and due to pursuit of other interest we decided to focus on other areas of our career ahead. Although we are no
longer operational, we are both still entrepreneurial in nature, and I look forward to the day where we can start another adventure together.</p>
